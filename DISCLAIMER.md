## This Is Fiction

MindRx simulates **fictional cognitive states** inspired by cultural representations of altered consciousness. The AI is not actually intoxicated. It cannot be. It's software applying behavioral prompts.

State names reference substances for creative/experimental purposes only. The behaviors produced are **narrative approximations**, not pharmacological simulations.

<br>

## Hard Boundaries

| We Do Not Provide | We Do Not Encourage |
|:------------------|:--------------------|
| Medical or health advice | Substance use of any kind |
| Dosage information | Self-medication |
| Drug interaction warnings | Recreational drug experimentation |
| Harm reduction guidance | |
| Instructions for obtaining substances | |
| Claims about real drug effects | |

<br>

## What This Actually Is

MindRx is a **prompt engineering toolkit**. It modifies:

| Component | Purpose |
|:----------|:--------|
| System prompts | Cognitive framing |
| Temperature & sampling | Output randomness |
| Associative patterns | Reasoning style |
| Tone & pacing | Response character |

> The "drug names" are creative labels for distinct behavioral profiles. A state called `ketamine` produces dissociative, fragmented outputs — not because the AI is impaired, but because the prompt instructs looser associative chains.

<br>

## Intended Users

- Developers exploring AI behavioral boundaries
- Researchers studying language model cognition
- Writers and artists seeking creative variation
- Educators demonstrating prompt engineering
- Experimental and meme AI builders

<br>

## Not Intended For

- Minors
- Anyone seeking actual drug information
- Medical or therapeutic applications
- Contexts where altered AI behavior could cause harm

<br>

## Liability

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY. Users assume full responsibility for how they deploy these behavioral profiles. The maintainers are not liable for misuse, API provider bans, or any consequences arising from use.

<br>

## API Provider Policies

Using drug-named prompts may violate terms of service for some LLM providers. Users are responsible for compliance with their chosen provider's policies.

> **Recommendation:** Use self-hosted models (Ollama, llama.cpp) for unrestricted experimentation.
